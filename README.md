# ClusteringPractice
The project focuses on clustering using both K-Means and hierarchical clustering algorithms.
Firstly, the data is loaded into a Pandas data frame and the values are converted into a numpy array.

K-Means clustering is performed on the data using the scikit-learn library, and the results of the clustering are visualized by plotting the data points and the cluster centers. The dimension of the data is then reduced to 2 using the PCA method, and the result is visualized using a color plot where each cluster is assigned a unique color.

Finally, hierarchical clustering is performed on the data, and the results are visualized using a dendrogram plot, which shows the hierarchical relationship between the different clusters.
